                Building my first full-stack application has been an incredible journey filled with challenges,
                breakthroughs, and valuable lessons. As a developer focused on Angular and Spring Boot, this experience
                has given me practical insights into both frontend and backend development. In this post, I’m sharing
                what I learned from creating my project, the Universal Shopping App, which integrates Angular for the
                frontend and Spring Boot for the backend.

                <h3>Choosing the Right Tech Stack</h3>
                When building my full-stack application, choosing the right tools was critical. I settled on Angular for
                the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend due to their robust ecosystems and scalability. For the
                database, I chose MySQL, which is a relational database management system that works well with
                Java-based backends like Spring Boot.
                Here's why:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Angular:</b> Provides a structured framework, making it easier to manage complex
                        applications. The standalone components approach kept my codebase modular.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Spring Boot:</b> It allowed me to easily manage the backend, especially with its built-in
                        support for RESTful APIs , database integrations and the integration of security features.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>MySQL: </b>This relational database was perfect for managing structured data
                        such as users, products, and orders. Its compatibility with JPA (Java Persistence API) allowed
                        me to define relationships and constraints between entities with ease.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <b>Lesson learned:</b> Your tech stack should not only suit your project’s current requirements but also
                scale with future enhancements.

                <h3>Importance of Requirement Analysis </h3>
                Before jumping into development, I had to clearly define what the application needed to do. <b>Its the
                    most
                    important things that many beginners skip.</b> The requirement analysis phase allowed me to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Understand the needs of different user roles (customers and admins).</li>
                    <li>Define the core functionalities (product listing, cart management, order processing, and user
                        authentication).</li>
                    <li>Create an outline of the user journey for both customers and admins.</li>
                </ul>
                This phase required creating use case diagrams, context-level data flow diagrams (DFD), and even an ER
                diagram to map out the data structures and how they would interact with each other. One key insight was
                how
                critical it was to fully understand the functional and non-functional requirements before starting
                development.<br>
                <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
                <b>Lesson learned:</b> Proper requirement analysis is the foundation for a successful project. It helped
                me avoid unnecessary rework and ensured that all key features were built with the end users in mind.

            </div>
            <div class="mb-4">
                <h3>Setting Up Authentication and Authorization</h3>
                In a multi-role application (customers and admins), implementing security is critical. I had to ensure
                that different users had access to specific resources:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>JWT Authentication:</b> I learned to handle token-based authentication in Spring Boot using a
                        custom
                        JwtRequestFilter for securing APIs.</li>
                    <li><b>Role-based Authorization:</b> Managing roles like admin and customer became easier with
                        well-structured
                        backend logic.</li>
                </ul>
                However, I encountered issues while managing authentication between Angular and
                Spring Boot but eventually it is solved by breaking the problem in layers and debugging it layer by
                layer.

                <div class="text-center">
                    <img src="auth.png" height="320" class="rounded ">
                </div>
                <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
                <b>Lesson learned:</b> Managing security, especially in full-stack projects, requires meticulous
                planning. Understanding how roles interact with API security is essential for building scalable, secure
                applications.

                <h3>Frontend-Backend Communication: Handling API Requests</h3>
                One of the most important aspects of any full-stack application is how the frontend communicates with
                the backend. I learned:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>HTTPClient in Angular:</b> This helped me make API calls to my Spring Boot backend. By using
                        services in
                        Angular, I was able to structure the code efficiently.</li>
                    <li><b>Error Handling:</b> In a production app, handling errors gracefully is a must. I implemented
                        common error
                        responses like 401 Unauthorized or 500 Server Error, which helped in both debugging and
                        providing
                        feedback to users.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="text-center mb-4">
                    <img src="frontend-backend.png" height="320" class="rounded ">
                </div>
                <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
                <b>Lesson learned:</b> Debugging communication between the frontend and backend requires an
                understanding of both sides. Logs in Spring Boot and the Angular console were extremely helpful.
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="mb-4">
                <h3>Database Design and Data Relationships</h3>
                For the backend, I needed to set up a relational database structure using JPA. Working with entities
                like User, Product, Order, Coupon and CartItems was a core part of the project. Some lessons included:
                <ul>
                    <li>Handling different type of relationships between tables. eg: many-to-many relationship between
                        orders and products.</li>
                    <li>data flow between the frontend, backend, and database</li>
                    <li>Database security using access controls and encrytion, implemented to protect sensitive user
                        data</li>
                    <li>Implementing unique constraints for preventing duplicate records in the tables.</li>
                </ul>
                At one point, I faced issues with relationship between tables i.e. many-to-one or many-to-many ,
                which was resolved by managing the tables structure more efficiently.<br>
                <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
                <b>Lesson learned:</b> Proper database design is crucial from the start. Having clear entity
                relationships reduces bugs and simplifies queries.

            <div class="mb-4">
                <h3>Frontend Development: Managing State and Components</h3>
                Angular's standalone components made it easier to manage my frontend code by eliminating the need for a
                central app.module.ts. This structure helped me focus on each component’s functionality. Some of the
                lessons learned in frontend developement are:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Role-specific views:</b> Admins and customers had different dashboards, which I handled using
                        conditional
                        rendering based on the user's role.</li>
                    <li><b>Services:</b> : Implementing services that handles business logic, data retrieval, and
                        other functionalities in a separate file and injecting it in components.</li>
                    <li><b>Routing:</b> Handling Angular Routing enables navigation between different views or
                        components in a single-page application (SPA). The Angular Router helps
                        manage the URLs and the views associated with them.</li>
                </ul>
                I also dealt with managing local storage in Angular to store user tokens and session data. Encountering
                errors was part of the process, but careful debugging helped resolve
                these
                quickly.<br>

                <b>Lesson learned:</b> Angular's component-based architecture allows for a clean separation of concerns
                and also features like services , routing make it easier for developement.

                <h3>Handling Deployment Challenges</h3>
                Once the app was working locally, I had to deploy it. Deploying my full-stack application had its
                hurdles. I used GitHub for version control and deployed the
                frontend on Netlify and backend on Railway. I also faced some challenges:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Backend on Railway:</b> Setting up the MySQL database connection was tricky at first, mainly
                        due to misconfigured credentials in `application.properties`. Additionally, CORS issues arose
                        because the frontend and backend were hosted on different domains. Configuring CORS in Spring
                        Boot solved this.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Frontend on Netlify:</b> The deployment was smooth overall, but I had to adjust the **API
                        URL** in Angular’s production environment configuration to point to the Railway backend. I also
                        added a `_redirects` file to fix client-side routing issues.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <img src="deploy.png" height="280" class="rounded ">
                </div>
                <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
                <b>Lesson Learned:</b> Deployment is not just about getting the code online. It requires managing different
                environments, making sure build processes work properly, routing adjustments and sometimes troubleshooting platform-specific
                issues.

                <h3>Handling Reviews and Feedback</h3>
                In developing the Universal Shopping app, I prioritized the importance of handling reviews and feedback
                from users. This process involved implementing a structured system for collecting, analyzing, and
                responding to user insights. By actively engaging with customer feedback, one can able to:
                <ul>
                <li><b>Enhance User Experience:</b> Understanding users' perspectives helped identify pain points and areas for
                improvement, allowing me to make informed adjustments to the app's features and functionality.
            </li>
               <li><b>Build Trust and Loyalty:</b>  Responding to reviews, whether positive or negative, fostered a sense of
                community and trust among users. Demonstrating that their opinions were valued encouraged continued
                engagement and loyalty.
            </li>
                <li><b>Continuous Improvement:</b> The feedback loop created a dynamic environment for ongoing development,
                ensuring that the app evolved in alignment with user needs and market trends.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
            <b>Lesson learned:</b> By integrating a robust feedback mechanism, I learned how crucial it is for any application to not only
                gather user reviews but also to act on them effectively, ultimately contributing to the app's success.
